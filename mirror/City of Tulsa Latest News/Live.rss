<p>Not sure if you may have unpaid Tulsa parking tickets?</p>

<p>A <a href="/public-safety/municipal-courts/tow-list.aspx" title="Tow List">searchable
database</a> has been added to the City of Tulsa website&nbsp; to
allow drivers to look to see if their tag numbers are on the City's
Tow List.</p>

<p>The Tow List includes vehicles with more than one unpaid ticket.
Following the amnesty, listed vehicles could be towed and impounded
until tickets are paid.</p>

<p>To search the tow list, click on "Public Safety," then on
"Municipal Courts," and look for the "Tow List" link on the left
side of the page. By typing in a tag number it is possible to see
if that number is on the list.</p>

<p>If the answer to the query is an unfortunate "yes", then drivers
still have a chance to pay those tickets without additional fines
and court fees. Anyone with unpaid tickets on the tow list can save
money by paying past-due tickets by the close of business on
Friday, Feb. 7, 2014.</p>

<p>To pay City of Tulsa parking tickets at face value and avoid
costs during this amnesty period, vehicle owners may use cash or a
credit card at the cashier's windows at City Hall, 175 E. 2nd
Street, or at Tulsa Municipal Courts, 600 Civic Center, second
floor.</p>

<p>While tickets can be paid online, the benefits of the amnesty
program are not available through the online payment system, and so
tickets should be paid in person or by mail during the amnesty in
order to avoid additional costs.</p>

<p>After that, a $15 unpaid ticket for parking at an expired meter
could quickly cost a driver between $200 and $300.</p>

<p>Vehicles will be removed from the tow list when tickets are
paid.</p>

<p>The amnesty period is only for parking tickets at public parking
spaces, not for privately-owned lots, moving violations or other
kinds of tickets.</p>

<p>Those without internet access can call the City's Customer Care
Center - (918) 596-2100 -- to determine if they have outstanding
citations. They should have their car license tag numbers available
when calling.</p>

<p>The Tulsa Authority for Recovery of Energy
(TARE)&nbsp;&nbsp;voted on a variety of items related to the City's
curbside greenwaste program.</p>

<p>TARE members voted to suspend the greenwaste sticker requirement
until further notice. Members stated they would revisit the matter
after an enhanced greenwaste program is in place.</p>

<p>Residents can continue to leave their greenwaste at the curb in
2ft. across and 4 ft. long bundles or in clear plastic bags without
a greenwaste sticker.</p>

<p>TARE also moved forward to have staff work with consultant
Leidos, to draft a request for proposals (RFP) to pursue bids for
the curbside greenwaste program. Refuse and recycling services are
contracted.</p>

<p>The RFP for the greenwaste service would be a short-term
solution that would give TARE time to get a modified greenwaste
program in place that would implement long-term solutions. Staff
reported they expect to present the RFP for TARE's approval in
February. TARE has the ability to choose whether to accept or not
accept a proposal.</p>

<p>"The short-term solution of accepting a proposal on the curbside
greenwaste service will help the City bridge the gap from where we
are now with greenwaste to where we want to be in the future with
an economically feasible and operationally manageable program,"
TARE Vice-Chair Paul White said. "Not only would contracting
greenwaste service save a substantial amount of money in the
interim, but gives TARE the opportunity to evaluate the long-term
solutions recommended by the citizen/council taskforce and address
operational issues before a modified greenwaste program is
adopted."</p>

<p>The TARE Board also voted to continue a contract with QuikTrip
to sell the orange refuse stickers, which are required for
additional refuse that cannot fit in the refuse cart.</p>

<p>Drivers with unpaid parking tickets who don't pay during the
current amnesty period could see the cost of a $15 ticket grow to
$200 to $300, with late fees, court costs, towing and storage fees
added.</p>

<p>Tulsa's Municipal Court is conducting a three-week parking
ticket amnesty from Jan. 17 through Feb. 7, 2014. During that
period drivers can pay the face-value of the tickets only, without
having to pay late fees or court costs.</p>

<p>On Monday, Feb. 10, 2014, following the amnesty period,&nbsp;
the City's Security personnel will step up efforts to collect
unpaid tickets and will boot and tow cars that are on the municipal
court's nuisance list. Any vehicle with more than one overdue
parking ticket is added to the nuisance list.</p>

<p>Security officers will begin patrolling city streets to match
license plates and vehicle identification numbers with those on the
nuisance list. Those vehicles will be booted and the driver will
have a chance to pay the tickets and court costs and late fees
before the end of the business day.</p>

<p>If the fines and costs are not paid by closing time, the car
will be impounded.&nbsp; The City's towing contractor says a
typical towing fee and first-night's storage is about $200. Storage
for longer periods is about $20 for each additional day.</p>

<p>During the amnesty, vehicles will be removed from the nuisance
list if tickets are paid.</p>

<p>There are nearly 19,000 unpaid parking tickets in municipal
court files.</p>

<p>Holders of unpaid parking tickets can pay with cash or credit
card, either at the cashier's windows at City Hall, 175 E. 2nd
Street, or at Tulsa Municipal Courts.</p>

<p>The amnesty period is only for parking tickets, not for moving
violations or other kinds of tickets.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes they may have one or more outstanding
parking citations, but has misplaced the actual citation or does
not know the number, can call (918) 596-2100 to determine if they
have outstanding citations. They should have their car's&nbsp;
license tag number available when calling.</p>

<p>During a news conference this afternoon, Mayor Dewey Bartlett
announced several organizational changes within the City to help
strengthen and improve efficiencies and service to the citizens of
Tulsa. By <a href="/media/355599/2014-01.pdf"
target="_blank">executive order</a>, a new department and office
were created and other departments are making various
transitions.</p>

<p>Through the executive order, Mayor Bartlett created the Mayor's
Office of Economic Development to help streamline and simplify the
City's economic development efforts. This will be accomplished by
bringing employees who focus on economic development, but are
currently in several different departments, under a single chain of
command.</p>

<p>Clay Bird will lead the Mayor's Office of Economic Development
and is responsible for industry retention and expansion, retail
recruitment and marketing, the brownfields program, energy
efficiency and sustainability programs and help assist with film
and music and support the Downtown Coordinating Council.</p>

<p>Mayor Bartlett also created a new department, Asset Management,
which is responsible for all activities related to fleet
management, parking enforcement, repair and installation, security
services, property/facility acquisitions, management and
disposition. The interim director for Asset Management is Mark
Hogan. (The Equipment Management Dept. becomes a division of the
Asset Management Dept.)</p>

<p>By executive order, the Department of 911 Public Safety
Communications is now a division in the Tulsa Police Department and
under Police Chief Chuck Jordan. This change will provide
management for the training, supervision and oversight of E-911
communication functions.</p>

<p>"With this reorganization, we are focusing on economic
development, public safety and efficiency which are vital to the
future of our city," Mayor Dewey Bartlett said. "In my first 100
days in office of my second term, it was important to make these
reforms, as promised in my inaugural address, which will help
improve efficiencies citywide."</p>

<p>Another transition for the City is the reorganization of the
Tulsa International Airport and R.L. Jones Airport. The Tulsa
Airports Improvement Trust and the City of Tulsa have approved a
new lease agreement transferring 150 City Airport employees to the
Tulsa Airports Improvement Trust, which is assuming all financial,
human resources and information technology services from the City
of Tulsa. The agreement is anticipated to save money, provide more
flexibility and make the airport more competitive.</p>

<p>"The agreement with Tulsa International Airport and R.L Jones is
no different than what the City has accomplished with the BOK
Center, Tulsa Zoo and the Gilcrease Museum," Mayor Dewey Bartlett
said. "With this transition, we are able to cut costs across the
board, putting both airports at a competitive advantage, so we may
lower our airline costs and attract vital air service to
Tulsa."</p>

<p>Bartlett added, "This transition also helps Tulsa stay in line
with personnel trends in the industry and gives the Trust the
authority to operate as its own entity, which helps with financing
mandatory projects and needs for both airports. While I served on
the Tulsa Airport Authority, this was an important topic of
discussion, as many airports around the country have partnered with
trusts to make their airports more competitive, and we are looking
forward to the benefits this partnership will have for our
city."</p>

<p>The executive order with department reorganizations will take
effect on Jan. 17, 2014. The Airport agreement is already in
effect.</p>

<p>During the news conference, Mayor Bartlett also announced the
consolidation of the Building, Housing, Fire Prevention, Electrical
Examining, Mechanical Examiners and Plumbing Appeals into one
consolidated Board of Appeals. This consolidation helps streamline
the appeals process.</p>

<p>Mayor Bartlett will be looking at other authorities, boards and
commissions for other efficiency efforts that helps simplify
various processes for both the citizens and volunteers of the
authorities, boards and commissions.</p>

<p>Drivers with unpaid parking tickets in Tulsa can pay the tickets
without paying late fees or court costs during the amnesty period
which will begin Jan. 17 and end on Feb. 7, 2014.</p>

<p>There are nearly 19,000 unpaid parking tickets on file with some
motorists having as many as 106 unpaid tickets.</p>

<p>Holders of unpaid parking tickets can pay with cash or credit
card, either at the cashier's windows at City Hall, 175 E. 2nd
Street, or at Tulsa Municipal Courts.</p>

<p>The amnesty period is only for parking tickets, not for moving
violations or other kinds of tickets.</p>

<p>Stepped-up enforcement and collection efforts will begin
following the amnesty period for drivers who still have not paid
their tickets.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes they may have one or more outstanding
parking citations, but has misplaced the actual citation or does
not know the number, can call (918)596-7761 to determine if they
have outstanding citations. They should have their car's
&nbsp;license tag number available when calling.</p>

<p>Vehicles already declared a public nuisance for unpaid parking
tickets under city ordinances will be removed from list after
outstanding tickets are paid.</p>

<p>Tulsa ordinances provide that any vehicle with two or more
outstanding parking citations may be declared a public nuisance by

<p>Drivers with unpaid parking tickets in Tulsa can pay the tickets
without paying late fees or court costs during the amnesty period
which will begin Jan. 17 and end on Feb. 7, 2014.</p>

<p>There are nearly 19,000 unpaid parking tickets on file with some
motorists having as many as 106 unpaid tickets.</p>

<p>Holders of unpaid parking tickets can pay with cash or credit
card, either at the cashier's windows at City Hall, 175 E. 2nd
Street, or at Tulsa Municipal Courts.</p>

<p>The amnesty period is only for parking tickets, not for moving
violations or other kinds of tickets.</p>

<p>Stepped-up enforcement and collection efforts will begin
following the amnesty period for drivers who still have not paid
their tickets.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes they may have one or more outstanding
parking citations, but has misplaced the actual citation or does
not know the number, can call (918)596-7761 to determine if they
have outstanding citations. They should have their car's
&nbsp;license tag number available when calling.</p>

<p>Vehicles already declared a public nuisance for unpaid parking
tickets under city ordinances will be removed from list after
outstanding tickets are paid.</p>

<p>Tulsa ordinances provide that any vehicle with two or more
outstanding parking citations may be declared a public nuisance by
a judge of the municipal court. Once declared a nuisance, the
vehicle may be booted or towed by the city and not released until
outstanding fines, court costs, late fees and towing and storage
fees are paid.</p>

<p>Other requirements for the rebate:</p>

<ul>

one year prior to application.</li>

<li>Recipient must be the family member who contributed the

<p>The City of Tulsa will send rebates to recipients after the
Oklahoma Department of Public Safety has verified age eligibility
and/or the Oklahoma Tax Commission has verified income eligibility.
This process will begin after the April 15 tax filing deadline and
will take several months beyond that. Some Tulsa residents may not
receive their rebates until the fall of 2014.</p>

<p>Mayor Dewey F. Bartlett Jr. said today that the City of Tulsa's

is 0.2 percent higher than the same period last year and 3.1

<p>Use tax revenues totaled $2,215,534, up 23.5 percent from the

<p>Tulsa Mayor Dewey F. Bartlett Jr. held a news conference to
discuss the City of Tulsa's available resources for the winter
season. Tulsa County Commissioner Karen Keith also spoke about the
resources available at Tulsa County.</p>

<p>The City's Streets &amp; Stormwater Dept. handles snow and ice
response on the city arterial streets with 170 drivers and support
staff assigned to 35 specific routes, totaling 1,768
lane-miles.</p>

<p>There are 63 truck-mounted salt/sand spreaders, 45 truck-mounted
snow plows, seven 4x4 pick-ups equipped with snow plows and three
motor graders for use as plows. The City of Tulsa also has 14,500
tons of salt to treat Tulsa streets.</p>

<p>Spreading and plowing routes are prioritized based on traffic
counts. Once the main streets are cleared and conditions permit,
secondary or residential streets near hospitals, schools and areas
with steep hills are cleared.</p>

<p>Tulsa County is responsible for 750 lane-miles and more than 200
bridges. Tulsa County has 25 vehicles including trucks, graders and
plows for snow removal. More than 100 employees are available to
treat roads with a sand/salt mix across the county.</p>

<p>City street maintenance supervisors monitor weather forecasts
and can summon workers at any time of the day or night to begin
spreading salt or sand on Tulsa arterial streets. The Oklahoma
Dept. of Transportation is responsible for most expressways.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, the City has also devoted more
resources to its winter response operations for Tulsa Police, MTTA
and other agencies to add four-wheel-drive vehicles and other
equipment needed during winter storms.</p>

<p>Immediately following the news conference, Mayor Bartlett and
the Tulsa Area Emergency Management Agency hosted a table-top
exercise with City of Tulsa personnel and supporting partner
agencies to focus on operations for winter storm preparation, which
helps enhance inter-department cooperation and support in a severe

<p>The City of Tulsa's 2013 Customer Confidence Report (CCR)
reports that the City's system continues to deliver high quality,
good-tasting water that is safe to drink and free of bacteria.</p>

<p>The CCR is an annual water quality report required to be mailed
to all water customers under the provisions of the federal 1996
Safe Drinking Water Act and its amendments. The City samples and
analyzes its treated drinking water throughout the year to make
sure it meets or exceeds federal standards.</p>

<p>The report concluded that tests conducted on treated water
during 2012 showed that the levels of all contaminants continued to
fall below the regulatory levels prescribed by the Environmental
Protection Agency.</p>

<p>The CCR is included with the June utility bills mailed to
customers within the City of Tulsa and is also provided to
municipal water systems that purchase water from Tulsa. Anyone who
does not receive a copy and wishes to see one can request it from
the City of Tulsa's Customer Care Center by calling (918) 596-2100
or by email to <a

<p>The City of Tulsa Water and Sewer Department operates two water

Spavinaw and Eucha and Lake Hudson. Water samples from the lakes
also are analyzed to determine source water quality. Water and
sewer operations and policies are overseen by a volunteer body, the

<p>A dynamic light display to show off the artwork on the downtown
Boulder Avenue bridge has begun and continues nightly from sunset
to sunrise.</p>

<p>Each night at sunset, all of the artwork across the bridge will
be lighted with a bluish-white solid light for seven minutes. This
will be followed by an eight-minute, multi-color dynamic display.
The 15-minute cycle will continue all night until sunrise.</p>

<p>The dynamic light display will move across the bridge from the
south side to the north side. It will begin as dark blue, fading
into a yellow-red sunrise, followed by a white spotlight. The white
spotlight will fade into an orange-pink sunset, and then the dark
blue will reappear.</p>

<p>Special lighting is planned for a few holidays during the year.
The first will be red, white and blue lighting for July 3, 4, and 5
to celebrate Independence Day. Throughout the month of December,
the artwork will be lighted in red and green. Green lighting is
planned for next year's St. Patrick's Day on March 17.</p>

organizations to celebrate strides taken toward open
government.</p>

<p>For the 2013 awards, the Sunshine Review analyzed more than
1,000 qualifying government websites and graded each on a 10-Point
Transparency Checklist. The checklist included items such as
budgets, meetings, lobbying, financial audits, contracts, public
records and taxes.</p>

of Tulsa website (www.cityoftulsa.org): current permits, monthly
commercial and residential permits, financial reports, Grants
Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER),
