<p>Mayor Dewey F. Bartlett Jr. said today that the City of Tulsa's
February sales tax revenue for mid-December 2013 to mid-January
2014, as reported by the Oklahoma Tax Commission, totaled
$21,026,499, which is up 2 percent from last year and 2.9 percent
below budget estimates. Year-to-date sales tax collections are up
0.7 percent for this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year.</p>

<p>Holiday sales are reflected in the January and February checks
the City received. In the general fund, sales tax collections for
the two months were expected to grow by 2.8 percent from last
year's $26 million level, but instead fell by 0.6 percent leaving a
$ 900,000 shortfall against budget expectations.</p>

<p>"In spring of 2013, the economic indicators initially supported
a 3 percent sales tax growth for FY 14. However, the reality is the
local economy has shown signs of softness," said Finance Director
Mike Kier. "Buyer habits are changing as consumers are using credit
less and saving more and buying goods online from out-of-state
retailers that do not collect state or city sales taxes. Tulsa is
losing approximately $10 million in sales this year due to tax-free
internet sales."</p>

<p>Use tax revenues totaled $2,744,807, which is up 30 percent from
the same period a year ago, and 24 percent above budget estimates
for the month. Year-to-date use tax collections are up 13.2 percent
for this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year, and 8.5 percent
above the year-to-date budget estimate.</p>

<p>"With softening sales tax collections in the current economy, we
must face the likelihood that the City of Tulsa's sales tax
reimbursement will stay somewhat flat moving forward," Mayor Dewey
Bartlett said. "We must remain prudent in our budgetary decisions
and find long-term solutions to provide core services to the
citizens of Tulsa."</p>

<p>Founded in 2008, the Rotary Club of Tulsa's Above and Beyond
Awards recognize Tulsa's police officer and firefighter of the
year. The event acknowledges these public servants for outstanding
acts of character, commitment and compassion to both their
profession and community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nominated by their peers, the award recipients have gone "Above
and Beyond" by serving their communities and exemplifying the
values reflected in the Rotary Four-Way Test.&nbsp; Award
nominations were provided by each respective department and
recipients were selected by a committee of the Rotary Club of
Tulsa.</p>

<p><strong><span>Police Officer of the Year - Detective Elizabeth
Eagan</span></strong></p>

<p>A 31-year veteran of the Tulsa Police Department, Detective
Elizabeth Eagan has spent the last 11 years working in the Sex
Crimes Unit as an unrelenting and tenacious officer who pursues
justice for individuals that have been victims of horrific
crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When not protecting our community's most vulnerable citizens,
Detective Eagan is an active volunteer of Going Home Animal Rescue
&amp; Transport, an organization that transports animals between
rescue groups and municipal shelters that are at over capacity so
that animals may have an opportunity to become an adoptable
pet.</p>

<p>Detective Eagan has contributed hundreds of hours to care for
neglected animals and has transported many of them across the
country to locations such as Denver, Chicago and Cincinnati. Eagan
also volunteered to rescue and transport animals that were lost and
abandoned due to the fatal tornado in Moore, Okla.</p>

<p>Eagan's dedication of service to both her profession and
volunteer efforts will have a positive and lasting impact on those
touched by her work.</p>

<p>TPD nominated Detective Eagan for the Rotary Club of Tulsa's
Above and Beyond Award. The Rotary Club of Tulsa will honor
Detective Eagan with a $1,000 donation to the Going Home Animal
Rescue &amp; Transport organization.</p>

<p><strong><span>Firefighter of the Year - Raymond
Beard</span></strong></p>

<p>A 13 year veteran of the Tulsa Fire Department and driver for
Station 22, Raymond Beard embodies the meaning of 'service above
self'. In addition to protecting and serving Tulsa citizens as a
dedicated firefighter, Beard is a dedicated and active member of
the East Virgin Street Church of Christ.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>When Beard learned that a fellow church member was in search of
a kidney donor, he volunteered to undergo the necessary testing to
determine if he could be a compatible match.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After lab results indicated that Beard was indeed a donor match,
he without hesitation and selflessly volunteered to donate his
kidney to the congregation member. Beard used his allotted sick
leave and vacation time from work so that he could donate his
kidney and provide the gift of life to another human being.</p>

<p>Beard risks his life daily to protect and save the property and
lives of Tulsans. The act of donating his kidney to an individual
in need exemplifies the true spirit of going above and beyond.</p>

<p>Beard was nominated by a leader of TFD for the Rotary Club of
Tulsa's Above and Beyond Award. The Rotary Club will donate $1,000
to the Tulsa Youth Athletic Association.</p>

<p>As Tulsans begin filing their 2013 income tax returns, they need
to remember that they are required to pay use tax on their online
purchases from retailers without a presence in the state of
Oklahoma. The City of Tulsa receives use tax as a proportion of
what is paid to the state.</p>

<p>Sales tax and use tax collections provide two-thirds of the City
of Tulsa's revenue. Vital services such as police and fire
protection, 911 emergency dispatch, snow and ice removal from
streets, pothole repair and mowing of grass in medians and parks
are supported by sales and use taxes.</p>

<p>Use tax is the same amount as sales tax - in Tulsa it's 8.517
percent - but it is paid on out-of-state purchases that were not
taxed at the point of sale. State tax forms explain how to
calculate the tax or estimate it if taxpayers don't remember what
they bought online. It's entered on line 20 of the tax forms.</p>

<p>The City of Tulsa Finance Department estimates that the City
would have $10 million more per year if Tulsa residents paid the
use taxes they owe. Currently 97 percent of Oklahoma taxpayers
ignore the use tax, which relies on the honor system because
federal law does not require online retailers to collect the tax
for states, cities and counties.</p>

<p>The Tulsa Authority for Recovery of Energy
(TARE)&nbsp;&nbsp;voted on a variety of items related to the City's
curbside greenwaste program.</p>

<p>TARE members voted to suspend the greenwaste sticker requirement
until further notice. Members stated they would revisit the matter
after an enhanced greenwaste program is in place.</p>

<p>Residents can continue to leave their greenwaste at the curb in
2ft. across and 4 ft. long bundles or in clear plastic bags without
a greenwaste sticker.</p>

<p>TARE also moved forward to have staff work with consultant
Leidos, to draft a request for proposals (RFP) to pursue bids for
the curbside greenwaste program. Refuse and recycling services are
contracted.</p>

<p>The RFP for the greenwaste service would be a short-term
solution that would give TARE time to get a modified greenwaste
program in place that would implement long-term solutions. Staff
reported they expect to present the RFP for TARE's approval in
February. TARE has the ability to choose whether to accept or not
accept a proposal.</p>

<p>"The short-term solution of accepting a proposal on the curbside
greenwaste service will help the City bridge the gap from where we
are now with greenwaste to where we want to be in the future with
an economically feasible and operationally manageable program,"
TARE Vice-Chair Paul White said. "Not only would contracting
greenwaste service save a substantial amount of money in the
interim, but gives TARE the opportunity to evaluate the long-term
solutions recommended by the citizen/council taskforce and address
operational issues before a modified greenwaste program is
adopted."</p>

<p>The TARE Board also voted to continue a contract with QuikTrip
to sell the orange refuse stickers, which are required for
additional refuse that cannot fit in the refuse cart.</p>

<p>This is the fourth and final year that $25 sales tax rebates
will be available from the 2008 Fix Our Streets package. Rebates
will be distributed in 2014 according to eligibility in 2013.</p>

<p>Residents must submit applications to the City of Tulsa to
receive a rebate. Applications for the 2013 rebate are due by April
15, 2014.</p>

<p>Tulsa residents may qualify for rebates either by age - 65 years
or older for any part of 2013 - or income through eligibility for
the Oklahoma Sales Tax Refund or Oklahoma Earned Income Tax Credit.
It is recommended that residents who qualify both by age and income
use age as their eligibility for faster processing.</p>

<p>Other requirements for the rebate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recipient must have lived in the Tulsa city limits for at least
one year prior to application.</li>

<li>Recipient must be the family member who contributed the
greatest share of income for his or her household.</li>

<li>Rebates are limited to one per household.</li>
</ul>

<p>Residents can obtain forms in several ways, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>At City Hall, 175 E. 2nd St. - Street Level Customer Service
Cashier and City Clerk</li>

<li>By request from the Customer Care Center, (918) 596-2100</li>

<li><a
href="http://www.cityoftulsa.org/cot/salestaxrebate/">Online</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The City of Tulsa will send rebates to recipients after the
Oklahoma Department of Public Safety has verified age eligibility
and/or the Oklahoma Tax Commission has verified income eligibility.
This process will begin after the April 15 tax filing deadline and
will take several months beyond that. Some Tulsa residents may not
receive their rebates until the fall of 2014.</p>

<p>The City of Tulsa's 2013 Customer Confidence Report (CCR)
reports that the City's system continues to deliver high quality,
good-tasting water that is safe to drink and free of bacteria.</p>

<p>The CCR is an annual water quality report required to be mailed
to all water customers under the provisions of the federal 1996
Safe Drinking Water Act and its amendments. The City samples and
analyzes its treated drinking water throughout the year to make
sure it meets or exceeds federal standards.</p>

<p>The report concluded that tests conducted on treated water
during 2012 showed that the levels of all contaminants continued to
fall below the regulatory levels prescribed by the Environmental
Protection Agency.</p>

<p>The CCR is included with the June utility bills mailed to
customers within the City of Tulsa and is also provided to
municipal water systems that purchase water from Tulsa. Anyone who
does not receive a copy and wishes to see one can request it from
the City of Tulsa's Customer Care Center by calling (918) 596-2100
or by email to <a
href="mailto:mac@cityoftulsa.org">mac@cityoftulsa.org</a> .&nbsp;
The water quality report can also be viewed <a

at <a href="http://www.tulsawater.com">www.tulsawater.com</a> The
CCR is also available in Spanish.</p>

<p>The City of Tulsa Water and Sewer Department operates two water
treatment plants that receive water from Lake Oologah, Lakes
Spavinaw and Eucha and Lake Hudson. Water samples from the lakes
also are analyzed to determine source water quality. Water and
sewer operations and policies are overseen by a volunteer body, the
Tulsa Metropolitan Utility Authority. The CCR also provides

<p>A dynamic light display to show off the artwork on the downtown
Boulder Avenue bridge has begun and continues nightly from sunset
to sunrise.</p>

<p>Each night at sunset, all of the artwork across the bridge will
be lighted with a bluish-white solid light for seven minutes. This
will be followed by an eight-minute, multi-color dynamic display.
The 15-minute cycle will continue all night until sunrise.</p>

<p>The dynamic light display will move across the bridge from the
south side to the north side. It will begin as dark blue, fading
into a yellow-red sunrise, followed by a white spotlight. The white
spotlight will fade into an orange-pink sunset, and then the dark
blue will reappear.</p>

<p>Special lighting is planned for a few holidays during the year.
The first will be red, white and blue lighting for July 3, 4, and 5
to celebrate Independence Day. Throughout the month of December,
the artwork will be lighted in red and green. Green lighting is
planned for next year's St. Patrick's Day on March 17.</p>
