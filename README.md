OpenTulsaDataTools
==================

Tools and Documentation for working with the Open Tulsa Datasets.

In May 2013, the Tulsa City Council and Mayor of Tulsa adopted the
[Open and Accessible Data Resolution](https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/353986/resolution.pdf),
with direction to provide more data online and work toward a higher
level of transparency.

In January 2014, the City of Tulsa launched
[Open Tulsa](https://www.cityoftulsa.org/our-city/open-tulsa/about-open-tulsa.aspx),
a portal for highlighting published datasets and encouraging the release of
new open data sets.  They are also
[requesting feedback](https://www.cityoftulsa.org/our-city/open-tulsa/suggest-dataset.aspx)
on the site and other datasets that citizens would like to see.

This repository is for documenting the
[published datasets](https://www.cityoftulsa.org/our-city/open-tulsa/open-tulsa-dataset-list.aspx),
and providing sample software for working with the datasets.
